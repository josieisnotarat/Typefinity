# TypeFinity

A playful word-fusion game powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o.

---

## 📋 Features

* **Word Fusion**: Enter combos like `fire water` and get results like `steam`.
* **Dynamic Word Bank**: New words are added automatically as you discover them.
* **Snarky Explanations**: Use `!logic` to get increasingly annoyed explanations.
* **Escalating Roasts**: The more you ask, the meaner it gets. 4th time? Just `bruh`.
* **Persistent Save/Load**: Game state is saved using Pickle.
* **Safe API Key Handling**: Uses `.env` to store your OpenAI key.
* **Skipforceclose Override**: Bypass the sassy quit block when things get too real.
